                BASED IN THE PHILIPPINES.</h1>

                FAR.</h1>

                    <h4>2001 – 2020</h4>
                    <p>At an early age, I developed a passion for design, often drawing inspiration from my father, who
                        is really skilled at drawing. I would watch him sketch and create amazing art, and I felt
                        motivated to imitate his style. Drawing cartoons and anime became a daily routine, and it
                        sparked a deep creative drive in me. His influence was a big part of my childhood creativity,
                        and it fueled my desire to learn and experiment with different forms of art.
                        As I continued to draw, I started experimenting with different techniques and mediums. I won
                        small design competitions and worked on personal projects, which helped me develop an eye for
                        aesthetics, composition, and storytelling. These experiences taught me the importance of
                        attention to detail and how to communicate ideas visually.</p>

                    <p>My passion for art led me to explore various creative fields, and I eventually decided to pursue
                        ICT animation. This was a pivotal moment in my journey, as it allowed me to develop my skills in
                        digital art, 3D modeling, and animation. The skills I gained during this time not only gave me a
                        strong technical foundation but also taught me how to think critically and approach design with
                        a problem-solving mindset.

                        In 2021, I had the chance to apply everything I had learned during my time in ICT animation in
                        an
                        immersion program. This opportunity allowed me to work on real-world projects and collaborate
                        with other talented individuals. My work was even featured in an international conference, which
                        was a huge milestone for me. It was a validation of all the hard work I had put into refining my
                        skills, and it motivated me to continue pushing the boundaries of my creativity.</p>

                    <p>Looking back, my journey from childhood doodles to professional work in animation has been
                        incredibly rewarding. Each experience has contributed to my growth as a designer, and I’m
                        excited to see where this journey will take me next. I’m always eager to learn more and explore
                        new creative possibilities.</p>

                    <h4>2021 – Present</h4>
                    <p>Today, my work spans across <span class="highlight">3D visualization, illustration, and
                            branding</span>. I focus on bringing ideas to life through detailed renders, dynamic
                        compositions, and storytelling. Over the years, I have honed my craft to ensure that every
                        design I create not only looks appealing but also effectively communicates the vision behind it.
                        I've worked on a variety of projects, from game concept art to commercial branding,
                        collaborating
                        with diverse clients and businesses. These experiences have helped me refine my skills, learning
                        to tailor designs to meet specific needs while pushing creative boundaries. My goal is to create
                        designs that not only look good but also communicate a strong visual identity that resonates
                        with the target audience.</p>

                    <p>Whether it’s <span class="highlight">3D modeling, illustrations, or branding</span>, I aim to
                        push creative boundaries and bring unique ideas to life. My work is driven by a deep passion for
                        innovation and a commitment to creating impactful, visually stunning designs. I strive to stay
                        ahead of design trends and continuously explore new techniques and technologies to elevate my
                        projects.
                        In addition to my professional work, I’ve taken part in various immersive programs, workshops,
                        and industry conferences. These opportunities have allowed me to network with like-minded
                        creators and stay updated on the latest developments in the design and animation world. Every
                        project I take on is an opportunity to learn, grow, and deliver work that I can be truly proud
                        of.</p>
                    <p>As I continue to develop my skills, I am always eager to explore new areas of design, collaborate
                        with new clients, and tackle fresh challenges. The journey from learning the basics of digital
                        art to mastering complex 3D visualizations has been incredibly fulfilling, and I look forward to
                        the many opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
